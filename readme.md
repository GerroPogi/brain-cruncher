# Brain Cruncher

A small project made by my Math teacher that exercises students to be proficient in arithmetic and power operations. It uses random integers, and follows rules to let you play the game.

## How to use it

1. Open up terminal and install the required packages by doing `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run the `main.py` by doing `python main.py`.

3. Open up `localhost:5000` to start playing the game.

4. Enjoy!

## How to spice it up
    There's not much to add, because it's a new project. But I do have ideas.
